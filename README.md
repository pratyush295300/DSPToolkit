## 🌟 Overview

DSPToolkit is a passion project born from my journey as a 3rd-year ECE student and self-taught programmer. It combines theoretical concepts from my ongoing studies with practical implementations I've learned through self-study, creating a bridge between classroom learning and real-world applications.

### Why DSPToolkit?
- 🎓 Built with students in mind
- 🔒 Security-first approach
- 📊 Comprehensive signal analysis
- 🚀 Easy to learn, ready for real projects
- 💡 Well-documented with examples

## ⚡ Features

### Signal Processing
- **Advanced Signal Generation**
  ```python
  # Generate a clean sine wave
  signal = generator.sine(freq=440, duration=1.0)
  ```
  - Sine, square, and chirp signals
  - Customizable waveform parameters
  - Precise frequency control
  - Noise generation (white, pink)

- **Digital Filtering**
  ```python
  # Apply a low-pass filter
  filtered = filters.low_pass(signal, cutoff=1000)
  ```
  - FIR and IIR implementations
  - Low-pass, high-pass, band-pass filters
  - Moving average filters
  - Custom filter design capabilities

- **Transform Operations**
  ```python
  # Perform FFT analysis
  spectrum = transforms.fft(signal)
  ```
  - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
  - Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
  - Spectral analysis tools
  - Time-frequency analysis

### 🔒 Security Features
- Parameter validation and sanitization
- Secure random number generation
- Memory-safe operations
- Signal integrity verification

### 📊 Analysis Tools
- Time domain analysis
- Frequency domain analysis
- System response evaluation
- Signal quality assessment

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pratyush295300/DSPToolkit.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Quick Start

```python
from dsptoolkit import SignalGenerator, DigitalFilters, Analyzer

# Create a test signal
gen = SignalGenerator()
signal = gen.generate_sine(freq=440, amplitude=1.0)

# Apply filtering
filt = DigitalFilters()
clean_signal = filt.low_pass(signal, cutoff_freq=200)

# Analyze results
analyzer = Analyzer()
spectrum = analyzer.get_frequency_spectrum(clean_signal)
```
