# DSPToolkit - Digital Signal Processing Library

A comprehensive signal processing library focused on audio processing and analysis, developed through self-study and coursework at ITER, SOA University. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of DSP concepts, combining academic learning with self-taught expertise in signal processing and security.

## Motivation
As a self-taught programmer and ECE student at ITER with a passion for both Signal Processing and Cybersecurity, I've developed this toolkit to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications. What started as a personal learning project in audio processing has evolved into a robust signal processing library, showcasing both academic knowledge and self-acquired programming expertise.

## Key Features
- Signal Generation (sine, square waves, custom waveforms)
- Time Domain Analysis with secure data handling
- Frequency Domain Analysis with input validation
- Digital Filters (FIR, IIR implementations)
- Audio Processing Tools with data integrity checks
- Advanced Noise Reduction
- Signal Visualization
- Secure Random Number Generation
- Input Sanitization and Validation
- Memory-safe Operations

## Security Features
- Input validation for all signal parameters
- Secure random number generation for noise
- Memory-safe array operations
- Buffer overflow prevention
- Error handling with secure logging
- Protection against floating-point vulnerabilities
- Secure file operations

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
